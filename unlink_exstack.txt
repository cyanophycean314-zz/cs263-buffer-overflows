Which buffer overflow from bugs.txt does unlink_exstack.py trigger?

[http.c:282]

Explain whether or not each of the other buffer overflow vulnerabilities from bugs.txt can be exploited in this same manner.

The other buffer overflows cannot exploit the existence of a function pointer like I have here. Instead they can do so by overwriting the return address.
