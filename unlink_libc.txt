Which buffer overflow from bugs.txt does unlink_libc_1.py trigger?

[http.c:282]

Explain whether or not each of the other buffer overflow vulnerabilities from bugs.txt can be exploited in this same manner (as in unlink_libc_1.py).

This one overwrites a function pointer so the other ones cannot be exploited in a similar way.

Which buffer overflow from bugs.txt does unlink_libc_2.py trigger?

[http.c:165]

Explain whether or not each of the other buffer overflow vulnerabilities from bugs.txt can be exploited in this same manner (as in unlink_libc_2.py).

Yes this is similar to the other exploits in which you can overwrite the return address with the next return address. (but not the function pointer one)
