Imagine we did not have access to the source. You can simply HTTP request all the source files. One way you could do is by requesting the Makefile('GET /Makefile HTTP/1.0'). This would give you information on what type of programs are powering the server in the background, making it much more easy to exploit. With this information, the attacker can see exactly how the internals of the system, letting them spot buffer overflows as well as potentially server/customer secrets or data encoded. This can be prevented by either permissioning the server source files such that the server can't access them on the fly or running the server in a different location than its source.
